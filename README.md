# Nested Drag and Drop Config Tool
A nested drag and drop config tool based on [atlaskit/tree](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/confluence/tree) (deprecated)

## Demo
You can check the live demo here:
[Codesandbox Demo](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/ntw26c)

## The Challenge
I found that to create or delete an item from the tree by directly using mutateTree can cause error, so I wrote the custom functions for it :)

## The Goal
It was hard for me to find an example of manipulating the tree and upon frustration, I created this. It's not the final refined version that's on my local machine but it's working at the very least.

So I hope you enjoy it and I maybe will update it in the future for more featured components:<br/>
  e.g. the configured nested tags for filtering products with customizable styles and classes.

Here are some screenshots for the refined and more featured components:

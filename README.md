# Nested Drag and Drop Config Tool
A nested drag and drop config tool based on [atlaskit/tree](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/confluence/tree) (deprecated)

## Demo
You can check the live demo here:
[Codesandbox Demo](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/ntw26c)

## The Challenge
I found that creating or deleting an item from the tree by directly using mutateTree can cause an error, so I wrote the custom functions for it :)

## The Goal
It was difficult for me to find an example of manipulating the tree, so I created this. It's not the final refined version on my local machine, but it's working, at the very least.

So I hope you enjoy it and I may update it in the future for more featured components:<br/>
  e.g. the configured nested tags for filtering products with customizable styles and classes.

Here are some screenshots for the refined and more featured components:
